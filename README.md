# InformoAIðŸ’¬
InformoAI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that answers questions using the contents of uploaded documents.

## Features
* Document Upload: Users can upload PDF or DOCX files containing information.
* Text Extraction & Chunking: The app extracts text from the uploaded file, splits it into manageable chunks for efficient retrieval.
* Semantic Search: The app uses the FAISS vector store and OpenAI embeddings to find the most relevant chunks of text for the user's query.
* General Knowledge Querying: If no relevant text is found, the app uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT to provide an answer based on general knowledge.
* User Interaction: Simple and intuitive interface for users to ask questions related to the content of their uploaded files.
