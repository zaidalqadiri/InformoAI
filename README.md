**InformoAI** ðŸ’¬
InformoAI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that can answer questions using the contents of a user-uploaded document (PDF or DOCX). If no relevant information is found in the document, it will provide answers using general knowledge powered by OpenAI's GPT model.

Features
Document Upload: Users can upload PDF or DOCX files containing information.
Text Extraction & Chunking: The app extracts text from the uploaded file, splits it into manageable chunks for efficient retrieval.
Semantic Search: The app uses the FAISS vector store and OpenAI embeddings to find the most relevant chunks of text for the user's query.
General Knowledge Querying: If no relevant text is found, the app uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT to provide an answer based on general knowledge.
User Interaction: Simple and intuitive interface for users to ask questions related to the content of their uploaded files.
